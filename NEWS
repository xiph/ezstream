Changes in 0.4.3, released on 2007-07-24:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Plug the file descriptor leak, partially fixed in version 0.4.1,
             for good - it affected more than just the -q use case.



Changes in 0.4.2, released on 2007-07-17:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Make <stream_once/> work with playlists, too. Problem found by
             Geoff Shang <geoff at quitelikely dot com>.



Changes in 0.4.1, released on 2007-07-15:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Plug a file descriptor leak when using the -q parameter.

 * Documentation:
   - [FIX]   Minor spelling/consistency fixes.



Changes in 0.4.0, released on 2007-03-11:

 * src/util.*:
   - [FIX]   The xfree() function did not work as intended due to a programming
             error. Found, and fix suggested, by Karl Heyes.

 * src/playlist.*:
   - [FIX]   An error compareable to the one about xfree() in src/util.* has
             been fixed.
   - [MISC]  Refuse to execute a group- or world-writeable playlist script or
             program.

 * src/compat.c:
   - [ADD]   Implement a basename() function for Windows that behaves like the
             ones used on Unix systems.

 * win32/:
   - [MISC]  Remove the rather ugly HTML version of the man page from the
             distribution, and provide a much better PDF version instead.

 * various:
   - [ADD]   Allow ezstream to use TagLib for reading metadata from media
             files. TagLib (libtag_c) is now an optional dependency.
   - [ADD]   When built with TagLib support, include the song length in the
             "real-time" information line, if available.
   - [ADD]   New <metadata_progname> configuration option, which causes
             metadata to be read from the output of an external program or
             script.
   - [ADD]   New runtime control via the SIGUSR2 signal, which triggers reading
             of fresh metadata information from <metadata_progname> (metadata
             is always read at song changes.)
   - [ADD]   New <metadata_format> configuration option, to customize metadata
             strings when used with the new <metadata_progname> feature.
   - [ADD]   New '@a@' and '@t@' placeholders for separate artist and title
             metadata in de-/encoder commands.



Changes in 0.3.0, released on 2007-03-05:

 * The original author, Ed Zaleski, hands over ezstream maintainership to
   Moritz Grimm.

 * New features:
   - Playlist shuffling support, enabled via the new <shuffle> configuration
     option.
   - Playlist scripting support: Indicate that the executable in <filename>
     should be run each time to get a new media filename to stream, by setting
     the new <playlist_program> configuration option to 1.
   - New <stream_once> configuration option, which makes ezstream play a media
     file or playlist once and then exit.
   - New <reconnect_tries> option to restrict the number of reconnection
     attempts to a server in case the connection goes down.
   - Add feature to skip the currently streaming track, done by sending the
     SIGUSR1 signal to the ezstream process.
   - New command line option `-q': Suppress standard error output from external
     de-/encoders.
   - New command line option `-v': Produce more verbose output.
   - New "real-time" status display of the stream when both -q and -v are given
     on the command line.
   - Thorough configuration file checks with helpful error messages.
   - The @M@ metadata placeholder is now supported in <decode>.
   - Playlists may now have the '.txt' filename extension in addition to
     '.m3u'.

 * Fixes:
   - At least one stack and one heap overflow have been fixed.
   - Several memory leaks have been fixed.
   - Strict checking of the configuration file prevents unexpected behavior and
     adds another safeguard to prevent crashes.
   - Fixed and more portable signal handling.

 * Miscellaneous, user-visible changes:
   - Improved documentation. Ezstream now has a comprehensive man page and the
     README file has been rewritten.
   - Consistency improvements in the configuration examples. The examples are
     now also installed.
   - The <format/> and <match/> configuration elements, as well as filename
     extension matching to detect playlists in the <filename> element, are
     now case insensitive.
   - Various improvements in the build system and portability fixes.
   - Consistent and more helpful messages from ezstream. By default, ezstream
     no longer clutters the screen with lots of output (some information that
     used to be available needs to be enabled with the new `-v' command line
     parameter.)
   - Tweaked metadata string generation: no more lone " - " dashes at the
     beginning or end of the string.
   - New command line option `-V': Print the version number and exit.
