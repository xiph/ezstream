   EXAMPLE: Ogg Theora playlist stream WITH reencoding and sequential playback

   This example streams a playlist that may contain .avi and MPEG files.
   Ezstream will use the ffmpeg2theora program to both decode and reencode the
   video files to Ogg Theora. The output stream settings are controlled via the
   paramters to ffmpeg2theora.

       Since the reencoding feature is enabled below, <format /> sets the
       output format of the stream.

           Each <encdec /> element specifies a pair of programs to be used for
           decoding and encoding, respectively, and which file extension and
           output stream format they apply to.

           All the configuration of the output stream is usually done by using
           the appropriate command line parameters of the encoders in the
           <encode /> elements.

           New <encdec /> sections can be added for new input/output formats.

           Distorted audio, or audio playing at the wrong speed/pitch may be
           caused by conflicting sample rates in the various <decode /> and
           <encode /> sections, byte order (endianness) issues and mono input
           files. See the documentation on the various de-/encoders for
           the options that need to be used to create a consistent stream of
           raw samples.

               Support for THEORA. Ogg Theora streams are created differently
               with ffmpeg2theora, which does the complete reencoding on its
               own. Therefore, we only supply a <decode /> element and let
               ezstream pass through the resulting stream unaltered to Icecast.
